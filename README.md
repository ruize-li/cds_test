## Dependencies

### Front end

Javascript, html, React js

### Backend

Express js, Node js



## Instructions for development and testing

You will first need install `node js`. Go to [nodejs.org](nodejs.org) for downloads and instructions.

You need to start both backend server and front end application to start testing and developing.

To start backend server, do `cd backend` and `node App.js` and you will receive a message in the terminal indicating which port number the server is listening at.

Next, create a new terminal and do `cd cds_test_frontend && npm install` to install all dependencies. When it is done, run `npm start` to start the development server. Make sure that server and front end app are not running at the same port.
