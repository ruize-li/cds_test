## Dependencies
### Front end
Javascript, html, React js
### Backend
Express js, Node js

## Instructions for Development
You will first need install node js. Go to nodejs.org for downloads and instructions.


You need to start both backend server and front end application to start testing and developing.

To start backend server, do `cd backend` and `node App.js` and you will receive a message in the terminal indicating which port number the server is listening at.

Next, create a new terminal and do `cd cds_test_frontend` and `npm install` to install all dependencies. When it is done, run `npm start` to start the development server. Make sure that server and front end app are not running at the same port.
